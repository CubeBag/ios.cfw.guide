This is bad for jailbreaking, as most jailbreaks rely on exploits that have been patched in newer versions.</p><p>Fortunately, we can use different &quot;profiles&quot; to delay a firmware update. This is intended for organisations which require additional time to update their devices, however we can also use these to update to unsigned firmware versions.</p><p>This has a time limit, however.
